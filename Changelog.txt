 Notes: Added porting guide

 Detailed notes:
   - OTHER: Added a new porting guide to the documentation.
   - OTHER: Added a empty example for new ports to the project as a 
       starting point.

2006-08-01 (REL_0_8) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>
 Notes: Added Linux RTU/ASCII port.

 Detailed notes:
   - FEATURES: Added a new Linux RTU/ASCII port. The port should work
       on any linux distribution and it should be possible to run it
       on uCLinux.

2006-06-26 (REL_0_7) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>
 Notes: Changed the WIN32 serial port to better fit into the design.
 
 Detailed notes:
   - OTHER: Design of the WIN32 serial port changed. The polling function
       for the serial device are now called from the event loop.
   - OTHER: Debugging uses the same interface as the WIN32/TCP port.

2006-06-25 Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: Initial work on a Modbus/TCP port is available. The port includes
   an example for a Win32 port which uses the Winsock API.
   
 Detailed notes:
   - FEATURES: added required functions to core protocol stack to support
       a Modbus/TCP implementation.
   - FEATURES: added a Win32 port for the Modbus/TCP core. The port is
       currently limited to one concurrent client.
   - OTHER: The implementation of eMBClose to shutdown the protocol stack
       was changed to unify it with the new Modbus/TCP code.

 Detailed notes:
   - OTHER: while working on the Win32 port some linefeeds got
       wrong. Also some source files used tabs instead of spaces.
   - OTHER: prototypes for xMBUtilSetBits and xMBUtilGetBits fixed.
       usNBits should be ucNBits by convention.

2006-06-17 Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: Fixed various bugs with the Win32 port

 Detailed notes:
   - FEATURES: implement shutdown functionality for protocol stack.
   - FEATURES: protocol stack can be enabled and disabled during runtime.
   - FEATURES: interface functions now do more error checking. For
       example if eMBPool is called in an unitialized state.
   - FEATURES: extended Win32 demo application to use the new features.
   - BUG: fixed bug in Win32 demo for ASCII mode.

2006-06-16 Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>
 Notes: The new version includes a new port for the
   Win32 platform

 Detailed notes:
   - FEATURES: added Win32 platform

2006-05-14 Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>
 Notes: The new version includes a new port for the
   Freescale MCF5235 processor.

 Detailed notes:
   - FEATURES: added new MCF5235 port.
   - OTHER: fixed some missing code headers.

2006-05-01 Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>
 Notes: This version removes the t1.5 timers from the Modbus RTU
   implementation because noonene actually uses it and the CPU
   load is very high. T
   In addition some documentation cleanups has been done and the
   ARM demo has been updated.

 Detailed notes:

  - FEATURES: the t1.5 timeout has been removed. Therefore only
     one timer is required. 
  - BUG: the ARM demo project missed some files in the project
     workspace and did not compile cleanly

2006-02-28 Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>
 Notes: This version includes support for two new command 
   (write multiple coils, read discrete input)

 Detailed notes:
  - BUG: some function used the wrong datatypes
  - FEATURES: added support for write multiple coils function.
  - FEATURES: added support for read discrete input.
  - OTHER: some code cleanups with lint tool.

2006-02-28 Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: The new version 0.31 adds support for reading and writing the
   coil registers and add some bugfixes.
   
 Detailed notes:
  - BUG: fixed bug with to small modbus requests beeing ignored.
  - FEATURES: added support for write single coil function.
  - FEATURES: added support for working with byte packed bit fields
     to support coils and discrete inputs better.
  - API: API for set slave id functions changed.

2006-02-26 Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: First public release which includes an ARM and AVR port.
